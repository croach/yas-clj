This is a collection of Clojure snippets for the YASnippet template
system for Emacs.

Installation
============

Simply copy the `clojure-mode` directory into the `yas/root-directory`
which should be something like
`~/.emacs.d/yasnippet-*.*.*/snippets`. If you want to place the folder
inside of the `text-mode` folder instead, you must first remove the
`.yas-parents` file from the `clojre-mode` directory.
